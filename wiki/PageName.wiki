#BS2GRProxy Introduction

==Introduction==

A small app runs on Google App Engine as a reverse proxy to a specific site.

==Features==
  * Reverse proxy
  * Web pages, css/js and media files can be redirected to different hosts
  * Configurable through Google App Database view

==How to use==
  # Download the source package
  # Modify app name in app.yaml
  # Upload the app
  # Enjoy

==Configuration==
You can set default config in bs2grpconfig.py. But how ever it's not encouraged to modify the source code unless you understand it.

After the first run on app engine, a date entry is created in table "BS2GRPConfig". You can set run time config there using *Data View* in app admin page.
